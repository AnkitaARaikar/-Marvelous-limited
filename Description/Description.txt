The Program (demo.go.) is to call the three apis which are 

1.Avengers (http://www.mocky.io/v2/5ecfd5dc3200006200e3d64b)

2.Anti heroes (http://www.mocky.io/v2/5ed49b033300005400f7a25f)

3.Mutants (http://www.mocky.io/v2/5ecfd6473200009dc1e3d64e)
 
they have the list of characters and its power levels. 

Here the api's are called in parallel and the response is been stored in a data structure.
Type casting is been done for the max_power to display the data as required.
